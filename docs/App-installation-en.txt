Installation of TransektCount and TourCount


Two options:  


1. From F-Droid store (released versions)

   Apps, without docs or Basic database (Basic-DB) but with updates by the F-Droid app store:

   https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.wmstein.transektcount/
   https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.wmstein.tourcount

   After installation via the F-Droid store, the documentation and basic DB (and, if applicable, 
   regional or seasonal sample DBs from the author's GitHub pages (see below). 
   Copy these into the Documents/TransektCount or Documents/TourCount directory, which is created at the 
   1st start of each app. 

   Since apps published on F-Droid are compiled by F-Droid with their signature, 
   they are not mutually updateable from or with the corresponding developer versions.
   

2. From the author's GitHub project pages (current processing status)

   App, source code, docs and Basic- and sample-DBs:

   - TransektCount app, apk file (transektcount_release_nnn.apk):
	   https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/apk

     Docs as well as Basic and sample DBs:
       https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs


   - TourCount app, apk file (tourcount_release_nnn.apk):
	   https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/apk

     Docs as well as Basic and sample DBs:
	   https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs

   On the smartphone activate the Android option "Unknown source" in "Settings -> Security" 
   before Installation.

   After downloading, install the app by clicking on its apk-file in the download folder.
   Copy the Basic-DB and relevant sample DBs from the download folder into the APP data directory 
   (Documents/TransektCount respective Documents/TourCount).

   Important: Finally deactivate the option "Unknown source"!


Note on F-Droid:

   Getting apps from F-Droid is at least as secure as getting them from the Google Play Store.
   In contrast to the Play Store, all apps are also checked for data protection and compiled 
   by F-Droid itself. 

   If an app does not meet all of F-Droid's requirements with regard to undesirable features, 
   it is noted.

   The source codes of the F-Droid apps are published and licensed as open source.


Note on updates:

   In the case of major version jumps with functional additions, structural changes may have been 
   made in the internal database of an app. After such a change, the database version is incremented. 
   This is recognized by the app and the currently used DB is adapted internally.
   
   However, the currently adapted DB version cannot be used after a downgrade to a 
   previous app which uses a previous DB version. 
      
   The sample DBs are written and published in the current structure.
