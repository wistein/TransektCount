Version 5.0.0 (2025-12-29)
- This is a generally revised version that now implements optional GPS support to indicate a change of the current transect section. The use of GPS requires the provision of transect track data, described in the Help and the TransektCount_Userguide_5.0.0.pdf
- When activating GPS the app's name on the starting screen changes from TransektCount to TransektCountGPS
- With GPS activated the starting page shows a short hint message with the distance to the transect
- A toast message and a beep inform about entering a section different than the currently selected one
- Then, when visiting the page "Transect Sections" the name of the newly identified section is colored blue
- Optionally you may set the system permission for the TransektCount location service to "Always on" to get it reliably work for long inspections
- Program code has been adapted regarding aligned section and track handling for renaming, deleting and cloning a section
- The function "Add a Further Section" was moved from the Counting page to the page "Transect Sections"
- The option to change the font size for comments was removed
- On relevant pages the number fields show dimmed "0"-values for better readability
- Picture and data of Nomophila noctuella (Rush veneer) added
- Some messages worded more clearly
- For debugging in Android Studio's emulator, permanent app specific support was added
