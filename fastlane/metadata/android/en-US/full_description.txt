TransectCount is used by transect counters during transect surveys. It supports the species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.

New in Version 5.0.0:
- This is a generally revised version that now implements optional GPS support to indicate a change of the current transect section. The use of GPS requires the provision of transect track data, described in the Help and the TransektCount_Userguide_5.0.0.pdf
- When activating GPS the app's name on the starting screen changes from TransektCount to TransektCountGPS
- With GPS activated the starting page shows a short hint message with the distance to the transect
- A toast message and a beep inform about entering a section different than the currently selected one
- Then, when visiting the page "Transect Sections" the name of the newly identified section is colored blue
- Optionally you may set the system permission for the TransektCount location service to "Always on" to get it reliably work for long inspections
- Program code has been adapted regarding aligned section and track handling for renaming, deleting and cloning a section
- The function "Add a Further Section" was moved from the Counting page to the page "Transect Sections"
- The option to change the font size for comments was removed
- On relevant pages the number fields show dimmed "0"-values for better readability
- Picture and data of Nomophila noctuella (Rush veneer) added
- Some messages worded more clearly
- For debugging in Android Studio's emulator, permanent app specific support was added
- Some code and picture improvements
- Docs updated
- Bugfixes

Features:
- Data collection is based on a transect inspection
- Databases refer to a transect and can be individually created and customised within the app with regard to meta data, transect sections and expected species.
- The app contains an internal list with many European species and has a prepared database for a transect section with the most common species to be expected in Germany as a starting point for direct use.
- Export of the current species list for import by TourCount and TransektCount
- Separate counters for internal/external counting areas and separately for ♂-♀-indeterminate, ♂, ♀, pupa, caterpillar or egg
- Results page with prepared presentation for transfer to the input mask of Butterfly Monitoring Germany (web.app.ufz.de/tagfalter-monitoring/)
- The result can be output as an SQLite DB file or as a CSV table (e.g. for transfer and further use in a spreadsheet programme on a PC)
- The help contains detailed user instructions
- TransektCount supports counting in German or English language

Functions:
- Duplicate and delete transect sections.
- Editing the transect section lists (adding and deleting species and editing terms).
- Editor for meta data in preparation for an inspection
- Counter page per section with scroll-down list for species selection
- Species editor for annotation, bulk counter entries and count alert
- GPS support for selecting the current section
- The results page shows meta data, notes, totals and counting results per species and transect section

Prerequisites:
The app requires
- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data, 
- the permit to set the screen brightness, 
- the permit to prevent the sleep mode,
- optionally the permit for exact GPS location recognition.

The smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1024 x 1920 pixels.
The app can be used with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.

Documentation is provided under:

TransektCount is one of two apps for monitoring European butterflies. 
The second app, TourCount, supports the species-specific and individually GPS-localised counting of butterflies on any walk in nature. 

Both apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.
