TransectCount is used by transect counters during transect surveys. It supports the species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.

New in Version 5.0.1:
- Now if GPS identifies a different section the color if its name is also changed during the "Select Section" page is shown.
- Html formatting for app messages improved for different Android versions.

Features:
- Data collection is based on a transect inspection.
- Databases refer to a transect and can be individually created and customised within the app with regard to meta data, transect sections and expected species.
- The app contains an internal list with many European species and has a prepared database for a transect section with the most common species to be expected in Germany as a starting point for direct use.
- Export of the current species list for import by TourCount and TransektCount.
- Separate counters for internal/external counting areas and separately for ♂-♀-indeterminate, ♂, ♀, pupa, caterpillar or egg.
- Results page with prepared presentation for transfer to the input mask of Butterfly Monitoring Germany (web.app.ufz.de/tagfalter-monitoring/).
- The result can be output as an SQLite DB file or as a CSV table (e.g. for transfer and further use in a spreadsheet programme on a PC).
- The help contains detailed user instructions.
- TransektCount supports counting in German or English language.

Functions:
- Duplicate and delete transect sections.
- Editing the transect section lists (adding and deleting species and editing terms).
- Editor for meta data in preparation for an inspection.
- Counter page per section with scroll-down list for species selection.
- Species editor for annotation, bulk counter entries and count alert.
- GPS support for selecting the current section.
- The results page shows meta data, notes, totals and counting results per species and transect section.

Prerequisites:
The app requires
- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data, 
- the permit to set the screen brightness, 
- the permit to prevent the sleep mode,
- optionally the permit for exact GPS location recognition.

The smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1024 x 1920 pixels.
The app can be used with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.

TransektCount is one of two apps for monitoring European butterflies. 
The second app, TourCount, supports the species-specific and individually GPS-localised counting of butterflies on any walk in nature. 

Both apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.
