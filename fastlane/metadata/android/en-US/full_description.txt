TransectCount is used by transect counters during transect surveys. It supports the species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.

New since Version 4.1.0:
- Functionality of GPS-based selection of section removed as too unreliable
- File selection view enhanced with headline
- Preferences view enhanced with headline
- Preferences show their states in menu
- Separate views for editing, deleting and adding species
- Checkboxes for bulk deleting of species from the counting list
- Checkboxes for bulk appending of further species to the counting list
- Meta data enhanced with field for inspection note (replaces section notes)
- Preferences option added for sorting results either by section or species names
- CSV-export adapted to changes
- Internal Butterfly list now identical with the list of TourCount
- Other code, text and layout improvements
- Licenses text separated
- Deprecated function replaced
- Docs revised
- Bugs fixed

Features:
- Data collection is based on a transect inspection
- Databases refer to a transect and can be individually created and customised within the app with regard to metadata, transect sections and expected species
- The app contains a pre-prepared database with the most common species to be expected in Germany as a starting point
- Separate counters for internal/external counting areas and separately for ♂♀, ♂, ♀, pupa, caterpillar or egg
- Results page with prepared presentation for transfer to the input mask of Butterfly Monitoring Germany (www.tmd-daten.de or new: web.app.ufz.de/tagfalter-monitoring/)
- The result can be output as an SQLite DB file or as a CSV table (e.g. for transfer and further use in a spreadsheet programme on a PC)
- The help contains detailed user instructions

Functions:
- Editor for metadata in preparation for an inspection
- Counter page per section with scroll-down list for species selection
- Species editor for annotation, bulk counter entries and count alert
- Editor for setting up transect sections with species selection from a comprehensive scroll-down list
- The results page shows metadata, notes, totals and counting results per species and transect section

Prerequisites:
The app requires
- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data, 
- the permit to set the screen brightness, 
- the permit to prevent the sleep mode.

The smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1920 x 1024 pixels. 
The app can be used with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.

Documentation is provided under:

TransektCount is one of two apps for monitoring European butterflies. 
The second app, TourCount, supports the species-specific and individually GPS-localised counting of butterflies on any walk in nature. 

Both apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.
