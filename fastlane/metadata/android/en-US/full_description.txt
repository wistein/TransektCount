TransectCount is used by transect counters during transect surveys. It supports the species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.

New in Version 4.0.2:
- Option for automatic transect section recognition via GPS.
- Import function for a GPX file with separate tracks of the transect sections
- Restructured internal DB for the new functions (Attention! Updating the app or importing DB files of app versions < 4.0.0 change the species lists of all sections of the current DB to to list of the 1st section, as for the GPS controlled sections all section lists need to have identical species).

Features:
- Data collection is based on a transect inspection.
- Databases refer to a transect and can be individually created and customised within the app with regard to metadata, transect sections and expected species.
- The app contains a pre-prepared database with the most common species to be expected in Germany as a starting point.
- Separate counters for internal/external counting areas and separately for ♂♀, ♂, ♀, pupa, caterpillar or egg.
- Option for GPS-controlled selection of the current transect section.
- Results page with prepared presentation for transfer to the input mask of Butterfly Monitoring Germany (www.tmd-daten.de).
- The result can be output as an SQLite file or as a CSV table (e.g. for transfer and further use in a spreadsheet programme on a PC).
- The help contains detailed user instructions.

Functions:
- Editor for setting up transect sections with species selection from a comprehensive scroll-down list
- Editor for metadata in preparation for an inspection
- Editor for species annotation and bulk counter entries
- Counter page per section with scroll-down list for species selection
- The results page shows metadata, comments, totals and counting results per species and transect section.

Prerequisites:
The app requires
- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data, 
- the permit to set the screen brightness, 
- the permit to prevent the sleep mode,
- optional location query for GPS use.

The smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1920 x 1024 pixels. 
The app can be used with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.

TransektCount is one of two apps for monitoring European butterflies. 
The second app, TourCount, supports the species-specific and individually GPS-localised counting of butterflies on any walk in nature. 

Both apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.
