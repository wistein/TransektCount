TransectCount is used by transect counters during transect surveys. It supports the species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.

New in Version 4.2.5:
- Option to set the proximity Wakelock sensitivity (if supported by device)
- Corrected message when there is no suitable file for import
- Optional button vibration fixed for Android Version > 11
- Code, data and layout improvements
- Some minor bug fixes
- Docs updated

Features:
- Data collection is based on a transect inspection
- Databases refer to a transect and can be individually created and customised within the app with regard to meta data, transect sections and expected species
- The app contains an internal list with many European species and has a prepared database for a transect section with the most common species to be expected in Germany as a starting point for direct use.
- Export of the current species list for import by TourCount and TransektCount
- Separate counters for internal/external counting areas and separately for ♂-♀-indeterminate, ♂, ♀, pupa, caterpillar or egg
- Results page with prepared presentation for transfer to the input mask of Butterfly Monitoring Germany (www.tmd-daten.de or new: web.app.ufz.de/tagfalter-monitoring/)
- The result can be output as an SQLite DB file or as a CSV table (e.g. for transfer and further use in a spreadsheet programme on a PC)
- The help contains detailed user instructions

Functions:
- Duplicate and delete transect sections.
- Editing the transect section lists (adding and deleting species and editing terms).
- Editor for meta data in preparation for an inspection
- Counter page per section with scroll-down list for species selection
- Species editor for annotation, bulk counter entries and count alert
- The results page shows meta data, notes, totals and counting results per species and transect section

Prerequisites:
The app requires
- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data, 
- the permit to set the screen brightness, 
- the permit to prevent the sleep mode.

The smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1920 x 1024 pixels. 
The app can be used with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.

Documentation is provided under:
https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs.

TransektCount is one of two apps for monitoring European butterflies. 
The second app, TourCount, supports the species-specific and individually GPS-localised counting of butterflies on any walk in nature. 

Both apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.
