TransektCount serves transect counters on their inspection walks. It supports species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.

Features
- Data recording is organized according to a single transect inspection with a database instance per inspection.
- Databases can be individually created and adapted within the app regarding meta data, transect sections and expected butterfly species.
- You may use an individual species list per transect section.
- It contains a prepared basic database with most of the expected species as a starting point.
- Editor for the transect sections to setup or adapt its species
- Add new species to the list by scroll-down-selection from a comprehensive internal species list. 
- Editor for meta data to prepare an inspection
- Editor for species remark or bulk count entry
- Counting page with scroll menu to select species
- Count input per internal/external counting area and here each with separate counters for ♂ or ♀, ♂, ♀, pupa, larva or egg.
- Results are prepared for easy readout to transfer them to science4you entry masks.
- Results are shown with meta data, remarks, totals and species results per transect section.
- Results may also be exported in SQLite- or CSV-format and transferred to a PC for your own processing, e.g. by importing a csv-file into a spreadsheet like MS Excel.
- Help contains a detailed userguide.

Prerequisites
The app demands for 
- storage access permit which is needed for im-/exporting the counting data, 
- the permit to write settings for setting the screen brightness, 
- the permit to prevent the phone from sleeping (to control the counting screen when used under Android 5.0.1 or newer).
The smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1920 x 1024 pixels. 
The app is usable with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.

TransektCount is one of two apps for European butterfly monitoring. 
The 2nd app, TourCount, supports species-specific and individually GPS-localized counting of butterflies on any tour in nature. 

Both apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.
