  %1. Introduction
  !
  !This counting app should support you when monitoring your transect. 
  !It can substitute your field book and pencil, and with a modern smartphone you carry a camera for pictures of interesting species anyway.
  _ 
  !The integrated database is organized according to a transect inspection. That means, there will be used a new database instance per inspection.
  !Databases can be individually created and adapted regarding transect sections and expected butterfly species.
  !The recorded data (meta-data, counts and remarks) may either be read on the smartphone or transferred to a PC for your own processing.
  _ 
  !The app is open source (published on <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount</a>), has no tracking or advertising functions, demands only for permissions which are needed for recording the counting data (access rights for storage).

  % 2. Setting up
  !
  ! Before initial use you should adapt the settings to your liking. 
  _ 
  !Then you should edit the prepared species list of the 1. transect section of the internal database with the section editor. Add further species by clicking the (+)-Button in the head line of “Transect Sections”. 
  _ 
  ! Alternatively you can import and adapt a more comprehensive Basic DB for your transect. Example .db-files for download are provided on <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs</a>. Copy them to the app's directory /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.wmstein.transektcount/files which is created during the first start of the app. Now import and edit them suitably. When de-installing TransektCount this directory will be deleted. So it is recommended to backup these .db-files to a safe place. 
  _ 
  ! To edit the species list of the first section click the Edit-Button in the section line of “Transect Sections”. Add an entry by the (+)-Button in the head line of the section editor and select the species from the scroll-down list. At the end of this list you may select a non-existing species (NN). This can then be edited by entering its scientific name, code (five-digit with leading zeros and possibly common name, see Liste Tagfalter Europas.pdf (butterflies) or Liste Nachtfalter Europas.pdf (moth)<a href="https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs</a>). When finished click SAVE SECTION or the save icon. This list can be changed or supplemented anytime afterwards.

  ! Sect 01      (example part of a section list)
  ! ---------------------------------------------
  ! ...
  ! Pieris rapae .............. 06998
  ) Small white
  ! Pieris napi ................ 07000
  ) Green-veined white
  ! Pieris na./ra.-compl.	07000*
  ) Small whites complex
  ! ...
  _ 
  ! The codes will be used as an option to sort the list and as a reference to show corresponding butterfly icons. The codes derive from the numbering according to Karsholt/Razowski, as used e.g. in the German Lepiforum (<a href="http://www.lepiforum.de" target="_blank">http://www.lepiforum.det</a>). 
  _ 
  ! An appended *-symbol marks a group of similar species. Practically choose the biggest code of a species of this group for sorting.
  ! Click "Save List" to store the input into the database. This list can be changed or supplemented anytime afterwards.
  _ 
  ! In the next step, you could enter some meta data like transect-No. or inspectors name. Click on PREPARE INSPECTION and save the input by clicking the save icon. 
  _ 
  ! Once this list is complete, you can copy it for all remaining transect sections by the counting page menu function: "Duplicate Section List" and name each accordingly 
  ! (e.g.: Sect 02, Sect 03,...).
  _ 
  ! When you have created the section lists for all transect sections and entered the main meta data, the database is ready for export as a "Basic Database".
  ! For that you find the function "Export as Basic DB" in the menu of the starting page.
  ! After that you have a copy of the empty database saved as "Basic Database" (transektcount0.db) in the app's files directory (/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.wmstein.transektcount/files).
  ! The Basic DB does not contain any inspection related data and serves als a template for future inspections. It can also be exported again later, e.g. after changes of lists. Exporting as Basic DB ignores all counts, notes and inspection-related meta data.    
  _ 
  ! To prepare a certain monitoring inspection you will only need to enter the inspection-specific meta data.

  % 3. Usage
  !
  ! Start with PREPARE INSPECTION. Fill in the relevant meta data for the specific transect inspection. You may enter the current date and time by clicking the related field or enter any date and time by long pressing the related field. Finish with the SAVE-button. 
  _ 
  ! Then select TRANSECT SECTIONS. The screen will show the table with all sections. 
  ! Select the relevant transect section by clicking the section name. The counting page for the first species in the sorted section list appears.
  ! As counting of butterflies ought to be distinguished between those within the imaginary count area and butterflies outside this area you have 2 separate sets of counters (Internal and External of Counting Area). 
  ! To count just tip on the appropriate (+)-Button of the corresponding species. The (-)-Buttons allows for corrections.
  ! Each count is stored immediately. While storing the count the current date and time will be stored either. The date and a possible section remark will then be shown in the list of sections and indicate a successful inspection of that section.
  _ 
  ! To select another species just tip on the butterfly icon of the scroll down list on top of the counting page.
  _ 
  ! The Pencil-Button in the app bar of the counting page (as well as the Pencil-Button per section in the sections list) opens the section editing page for adding remarks for the section, adding species or editing the names of section and species. The section related remarks will be shown on top of the species list and within the section list.
  _ 
  ! The Pencil-Button beneath the species name row of the counting page opens the species editing page that lets you add remarks for each species and set its counters to any value. Here you may also set pop-up alerts which show up while reaching a set number of butterflies on the corresponding internal counters (sum of all ♂ and ♀) e.g. to realize already on site if a certain species is more abundant than on a previous inspection.
  _ 
  ! If you enter a species related remark this will be shown on the counting page in an extra line beneath the counting field.  
  _ 
  ! To move back one page you can use the arrow in the left upper corner. You should leave TransektCount from its starting page, as in this state the database is safely closed.
  _ 
  ! Some app pages have functional icons and/or a specific context menu (3-point-symbol) in their header.
  _ 
  ! When you have large lists or have collected big amounts of data the app may delay the start of pages, especially the results page, as this needs heavy calculations.
  _  
  ! Finally, there is a page showing your results. Here, in a scroll view you see beneath the meta data of the inspection all the species which got counts. You can enter this page from the Starting page with the SHOW RESULTS-Button or the Eye-symbol in the app-bar. It may take a few seconds to show up.

  % 4. Further functions
  !
  ! The menu on the starting page has Settings, Reset, Import, Export, Info and Help functions. 
  _ 
  ! The "Settings" page can be reached from some pages of the app. Here you may adapt the look an feel in some aspects to your wishes, e.g. sounds, alerts, sorting order of the lists or left-/right-hand counting page. 
  _ 
  ! For preparing a new inspection you may use “Reset Data” to reset the inspection-specific meta data and count data. Alternatively you may import the Basic DB. 
  _ 
  ! Android-specifically, TransektCount stores the data always in a single, equally named SQlite-DB file in the app's own protected storage area. As this file cannot be read or changed directly by the user, exporting the data to files in a user accessible storage area is necessary.
  _ 
  ! By “Export Basic DB” you may export the DB as empty "Basic DB" which is reasonable, when to take into account changes of the transect structure or new species you may have entered.
  _ 
  ! "Import Basic DB" always reads die file "transektcount0.db" from /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.wmstein.transektcount/files.
  _ 
  ! Exporting the current database (Export DB) writes a copy of the complete DB to /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.wmstein.transektcount/files/transektcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.db. For your own purpose you can rename the exported TransektCount DB files by a file manager into e.g. transektcount1.db, transektcount2.db, etc. (Mind: The db file name must start with the string “transektcount”, otherwise it cannot be imported).
  _ 
  ! You may import any previously exported TransektCount-DB. This supports monitoring of different transects. 
  _ 
  ! The function “Export Data -> CSV File” writes the meta data and the counting results into a MS Excel readable .csv-file to /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.wmstein.transektcount/files/transektcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.csv.
  _ 
  ! The (+)-Button in the menu of the "Transect Sections" page allows you to create new section lists. This function will be used only while creating the Basic DB or for changes in a transect. But a better substitute for this might be to copy an existing section list and adapt it.
  _ 
  ! The counting page provides the "Duplicate Section List" function. This function is used while creating a Basic DB, as described under "2. Set up".
  ! The menu of this page provides a "Share" function for sending notes using a standard app, like SMS or email.
  _ 
  ! From Android 5.0.1 on, the counting page is temporarily switched off by means of the proximity sensor when the phone is put into a pocket or held closed to the body. This saves energy, prohibits unwanted input and recalls the app into its current state immediately when used again.
  ! The menu of the counting page provides a "Share" function for sending notes using a standard app, like SMS or email.
  _ 
  ! IT-affine users may transfer the exported "transektcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.db" or csv-files from /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.wmstein.transektcount/files to a PC. 
  ! With a free tool like "SQliteBrowser" (<a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/" target="_blank">http://sqlitebrowser.org</a>) you may examine the .db-files.
  _ 
  ! You may import the .csv-file as a
  ! - comma-delimited text file 
  ! - with quotations marks for textfield recognition,  
  ! - file origin “Unicode UTF-8” and
  ! - all data as text
  ! into MS Excel (or compatible programs) for further processing. 
  _
  ! This table is optimized for easy transmission of the results into the butterfly monitoring web page like <a href="https://www.tmd-daten.de/platform-tmd/tmd/tmd-top/index.do" target="_blank">https://www.tmd-daten.de/platform-tmd/tmd/tmd-top/index.do</a>).
