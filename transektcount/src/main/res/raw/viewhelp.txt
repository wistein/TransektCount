  %1. Introduction
  !
  ! TransektCount is an Android app to support you when monitoring butterflies in a transect.
  ! It allows species-specific recording of individuals in all stages per transect section.
  ! It can substitute your field book and pencil, and if applicable a camera for documentary pictures of interesting species.
  _ 
  ! The integrated database is organized according to a transect inspection. That means, there will be used a new database instance per inspection.
  ! Databases can be individually created and adapted regarding transect sections and expected butterfly species.
  ! The recorded data (meta data, counts and notes) may either be read on the results page or exported into a spreadsheet and transferred to a PC for more comfortable reading or your own processing.
  _ 
  ! The app is published with source code and documentation on <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount</a>. It is open source and has no tracking or advertising functions, but demands access rights for its serviceable functions: Storage access which is needed for importing DB files, exporting the counted data into DB- or CSV-files and Wakelock to hinder the app from dimming or switching off.

  % 2. Setting up
  !
  ! Before initial use you should adapt the settings to your liking.
  _ 
  ! You should adapt the preliminary species list of the 1. transect section with the species list editing functions (add, remove or edit) for the species to be exspected in your transect.
  ! Add species from the integrated extended list of European species or remove species from the list using the checkboxes.
  _ 
  ! To edit the section name or species names in the species list click the Pencil button on the app bar of the counting page.
  _
  ! Add entries by the (+)-button in the app bar of the counting page and select the species from the blue scroll-down list with not yet listed species with its checkbox. Add all required species one after the other and finish with the back button either in the app or bottom bar.
  _
  ! Remove entries by the Remove button in the head line of the counting page. On the Remove page select the species to be removed from the scroll-down list with its checkbox. Mark all obsolete species one after the other and remove them with the Remove button and finish with the back button either in the app or bottom bar.
  _
  ! At the end of the species list you may find an unknown species (NN). This could be added and edited after determination by replacing its scientific name, common name and code (five-digit with leading zeros), see List of Coded Butterflies.pdf on
  ! <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs</a>).
  _
  ! Alternatively you can import and adapt a more comprehensive Basic DB for your transect.
  ! Example .db-files are provided for download on <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs</a>.
  ! Copy them to the app's public data directory "Documents/TransektCount" which is created during the first start of the app. Now you can import and edit them suitably.
  ! The app data directory is created during the first app call. When TransektCount gets uninstalled, the data in this directory is not deleted.
  _
  ! The species counting list can be changed at any time. Changes concerning species always affect all existing section lists. The section name may only be changed for the current section.
  _ 
  ! Sect 01      (part of a species list)
  ! -------------------------------------
  ! ...
  ! Pieris rapae .............. 06998
  ) Small white
  )
  ! Pieris napi ................ 07000
  ) Green-veined white
  )
  ! Pieris na./ra.-compl..07000*
  ) Small whites complex
  ! ...
  _ 
  ! The codes will be used as an option to sort the list and as a reference to show corresponding butterfly icons. The codes derive from the numbering scheme of european butterflies by Karsholt/Razowski, as used e.g. in the German Lepiforum (<a href="https://lepiforum.org/" target="_blank">https://lepiforum.org/</a>).
  _ 
  ! The appended *-character at code 07000 marks a group of similar species. Practically choose the biggest code of a species of such a group for sorting.
  _ 
  ! In the next step, you could enter some meta data like transect-No. or inspectors name. Click on "Edit Meta Data" and save the input by clicking the save icon.
  _ 
  ! Once this list is complete, you can copy it for all remaining transect sections by the counting page menu function: "Duplicate Section List" and name each appropriately, if possible in the order you will walk the transect (e.g.: Sect 02, Sect 03, ...).
  _ 
  ! When you have created the section lists for all your transect sections and entered the general meta data, the database is ready for export as a Basic Database.
  ! For that you find the function "Export as Basic DB" in the menu of the starting page.
  ! After that you have a copy of the empty database saved as "Basic Database" (transektcount0.db) in the app's files directory "Documents/TransektCount".
  _ 
  ! The Basic DB does not contain any inspection related data and serves as a template for future inspections. It can also be exported again later, e.g. after changes of lists.
  _ 
  ! To prepare a certain monitoring inspection you will only need to enter the inspection-specific meta data (date, start time, temperature, wind and clouds).
  _ 
  ! On older smartphones, the last delete icon in the section list may be displayed incorrectly and have limited functionality (not active, crossed out) due to a lack of RAM memory if there are too many section lists. More on this under 6.2 Messages.
  
  % 3. Usage
  !
  ! Start with "Edit Meta Data". Fill in the relevant meta data for the specific transect inspection.
  ! You may enter the current date and time by clicking the related field or enter any date and time by long pressing the related field. Finish with the SAVE button.
  _ 
  ! Then select "Counting". The transect sections list is displayed here.
  ! Select the relevant transect section by clicking the section name. The counting page for the first species in the sorted section list appears.
  ! As counting of butterflies ought to be distinguished between those within the imaginary count area (a cubus of 5 m length of edges in front of you) and butterflies outside this area, you have 2 separate sets of counters (Internal and External of Counting Area). 
  ! To count just select the species in the scroll list, and tip on the appropriate (+)-button of the category (♂♀, ♂, ♀, Pupa, Larva, Ovo) of the species. The (-)-Buttons allows for corrections.
  ! Each count is stored immediately. While storing the count of the 1st species in a section, the current date and time will be stored either in the section list. The date will then be shown in the list of sections and indicates a successful inspection of that section.
  _ 
  ! The Pencil button underneath the species name row of the counting page opens the species editing page that lets you add notes for each species and set its counters to any value (e.g. for estimated mass counts).
  ! Here you may also set pop-up alerts which show up while reaching a set number of butterflies on the corresponding internal counters (sum of all ♂ and ♀)
  ! e.g. to realize already on site if a certain species is more abundant than on a previous inspection.
  _ 
  ! If you enter a species related note this will be shown on the counting page in an extra line beneath the counting field and is inserted into the results table (e.g.: "Photo").
  _ 
  ! With large amounts of data, the app's response can be somewhat delayed for e. g. import functions or when calling up the results page, as extensive calculations are running in the background. This is indicated by a short message "View gets calculated...".
  _ 
  ! Finally, there is a page showing your results sorted either by species or sections according to the selected Output option. Here, in a scroll view you see beneath the meta data of the inspection the totals per category and all the species which got counts.
  ! You can enter this page from the Starting page with the "Show Results" button or the Eye-symbol in the app bar. It may take a second to show up.

  % 4. Further functions
  !
  ! The system menu on the starting page has Settings, Reset, Import, Export, Info and Help functions. 
  _ 
  ! In "Settings" you may adapt the look an feel in some aspects to your wishes, e.g. sounds, alerts, sorting order of lists and output or left-/right-hand counting page.
  _
  ! For preparing a new inspection you may use “Reset Counting Data” to reset the inspection-specific meta data and count data of the transect. All other transect-specific data remains untouched.
  _ 
  ! Android-specifically, TransektCount stores the data always in a single SQlite DB-file in the app's own protected storage area that is not accessible by the user.
  ! Therefore, it is necessary to be able to export the DB-data to files in a user accessible storage area. To make use of different DB-files for different transects, im- and export functions are essential.
  _ 
  ! Exporting the internal DB as empty basic DB "transektcount0.db" is reasonable, when to take into account changes of the transect structure, new species may have been entered or GPX Track data has been imported.
  _ 
  ! "Import Basic DB" always reads die file "transektcount0.db" from Documents/TransektCount.
  _ 
  ! Exporting the database (Export Current DB) writes a copy of the complete DB to Documents/TransektCount/transektcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.db.
  _
  ! For your own purpose you can rename the exported DB-files by a file manager into e.g. transektcount1.db, transektcount2.db, etc.
  ! (Mind: The .db file name must always start with the string “transektcount”, otherwise it cannot be imported).
  _ 
  ! You may import any previously exported TransektCount-DB. This supports monitoring of different transects with different sections and butterfly populations.
  _
  ! IT-affine users may transfer the exported "transektcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.db" files from "Documents/TransektCount" to a PC.
  ! With a free tool like "SQliteBrowser" (<a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/" target="_blank">http://sqlitebrowser.org</a>) you may examine the .db-files.
  ! Some useful prepared SQL-scripts can be found under <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs</a>.
  _
  ! The function “Export Data -> CSV File” writes the meta data and the counting results into a pre-formatted spreadsheet-readable .csv-file "transektcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.csv" to "Documents/TransektCount".
  ! This directory allows accessing the files by an Android spreadsheet app, like Collabora (open source, obtainable free of charge from the F-Droid store).
  _
  ! You may import an exported .csv-file into a spreadsheet program as a
  _ 
  ! - comma-separated text file with
  ! - file origin "Unicode UTF-8",
  ! - quotations marks " for textfield recognition and
  ! - all data as text
  _ 
  ! for further processing.
  _
  ! The exported table can be adapted by a sort option (sort by species or section) for an easy data entry of the results into a Monitoring web page like <a href="https://www.tmd-daten.de/platform-tmd/tmd/tmd-top/index.do" target="_blank">https://www.tmd-daten.de/platform-tmd/tmd/tmd-top/index.do</a>
  ! or
  ! <a href="https://web.app.ufz.de/tagfalter-monitoring/" target="_blank">https://web.app.ufz.de/tagfalter-monitoring/</a>
  _
  ! The counting view can be temporarily turned off via proximity sensor when the phone is put into a pocket or held close to the body. This saves energy, prevents unwanted inputs and brings the app back instantly when it is used normally again.
  _
  ! The menu of this page provides a "Share" function for sending notes using a standard app, like SMS or email.

  ] Section nn: To prevent DB corruption it is not possible to delete this section. Only the last created section may be deleted. If there is no section which can be deleted then your device has unfortunately not enough resources to execute the function.
  _
  ! With current models, however, this restriction should only occur with very many transect sections. Other functions of the app are not affected by this restriction.
  _
  ! No possible solution known. See the document "TransektCount_Userguide_4.1.pdf" for further info under <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs</a>.
