  ! TransektCount serves transect counters on their inspection walks. It supports species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.
  _ 
  ! TransektCount is one of two Apps for European butterfly monitoring.
  ! The 2nd app, <B>TourCount</B>, supports species-specific and individually GPS-localized counting of butterflies on any tour in nature.
