  	! TransektCount serves transect counters on their inspection walks. It supports species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method. 
  _ 
  	! TransektCount is one of two Apps for European butterfly monitoring.
  	! The 2nd app, <B>TourCount</B>, supports species-specific and individually GPS-localized counting of butterflies on any tour in nature.
